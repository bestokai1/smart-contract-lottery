## Smart Contract Lottery
**This is a demo of a smart contract lottery with the implementation of ChainLink's VRF technology**


## About The Project

This smart contract lottery allows users to enter the raffle, using ETH, with the hopes of winning the pool prize. A winner is selected at random after each raffle has been concluded.
